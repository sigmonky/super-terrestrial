highway 51 from liner notes:
A diesel-tempoed "Highway 51" is of a type sung by the Everly Brothers, partially rewritten by Dylan. His guitar is tuned to an open tuning and features a particularly compelling vamping figure. Similarly up tempo is his version of "Gospel Plow," which turns the old spiritual into a virtually new song


overview quote:
For the migrant Negro... the long ribbons of the "odd" numbered highways have a magnetic fascination.... He sings of Highway 49.... Often he sings of Highway 61... or of its fellow, Highway 51, on whose hard causeway countless thousands of flapping soles and bare black feet have made no indentation.... These are the best-known routes to the Southern Negroes...
Paul Oliver, The Meaning of the Blues, New York, 1963, pp. 82-83.


Curtis Jones

Highway 51 was credited to Curtis Jones on "Bob Dylan". What's curious about this is that Dylan's version bears no significant resemblance to Jones' '38 contribution recorded for Vocalion:both lyrics and musical arrangment are vastly different. Did Dylan provide this credit to Columbia A&R or did the company screw it up. Maybe Columbia had an interest in the publishing company? I haven't found any convincing explanation for this. 

If Dylan had heard this version, its appeal is obvious. No doubt the performance's musical excellence but also its collage storytelling approach, a commonplace in blues lyrics. Jones' "Highway 51 develops a narrative that circles around the topic, tentatively harmonizing vagueness,contradictions, incongruities, and anti-logic without challenging facile surface comprehension. It's mainfold semantic lacunae speak volumes and only hit the listener in retrospect. And in retrospect, what Jones says all makes perfect sense, especially when it doesn't. No lyrics better demonstrate the paradox of directness counter-balanced by spookiness and mystery that drew Dylan to American folk and blues music.

Sustained haunted mood. The way the disruptions of linear narrative logic summon a recondite coherence bear strong resemblance to techniques Dylan would deploy by the mid-sixties. In a most casual and unassumig way, the kind of travel alluded to here feels like the out-of-body kind.

Lyrics
Unlike McClennan or Dylan who start off hot pursuit of a love interest, Jones opens with a plea to an estranged lover for forgiveness -- perhaps only to defer the need to escape the consequences of his unspecified wrongdoing.

A1:Forgive me /honey for all the wrong I've done
A2:Please forgive me/honey for all the wrong I've done
B:I don't want nobody have to (be) comin' for me/ whilst(?) out on highway 51


Verse 2 deals with the premature death /burial site preference motif. It's interesting that the landmark is a railroad track -- the Frisco line -- hovering above the highway. Whatever it's significance as a physical marker, the reference to train tracks conjures up the recurrent presence of locomotive travel in blues repertoire. 

A1:If I should die/Baby, before my time ( playing with the sequence be-be -- playful in a way Dylan would pick up on)
A2:If I should die/baby before my time
B:bury my body on 51 highway/just down below the frisco line


In verse 3,which introduces the travel motif, Jones is trying to board a bus but still has trains on his mind. His reference to "your blinds" borrows a term frequently used in relation to hobo train travel to petition a bus driver to waive the fare for some covert,sketchy seating option. The hyperbolic B phrase -- though weirdly comic -- imaginatively expresses the singer's desperation and the extreme risks he is willing to take to bum a ride. This is decades before skate boards or rollerblades.


A1:Now, Mister Bus Driver/let me ride down in your blinds
A2:Mister Bus Driver/let me ride down in your blinds
B:And if you don't let me ride, man/I'm gonna swing right on behind






Performance
The vocal phrasing here is remarkable, alternating elongated pleas for forgvieness with rapid staccato admissions of guilt on the A phrases, and another rapid-fire burst of words on the first part of the B phrase ( 13 syllables in two beats!).
