Curtis Jones

Why given attribution at all?

Sustained haunted mood. The way the disruptions of linear narrative logic summon a recondite coherence bear strong resemblance to techniques Dylan would deploy by the mid-sixties. In a most casual and unassumig way, the kind of travel alluded to here feels like the out-of-body kind.

Lyrics
Unlike McClennan or Dylan who start off narratiing hot pursuit, Jones opens with a plea to avoid escape for unspecified amorous wrongdoings.

A1:Forgive me /honey for all the wrong I've done
A2:Please forgive me/honey for all the wrong I've done
B:I don't want nobody have to (be) comin' for me/ whilst(?) out on highway 51


Verse 2 deals with the premature death /burial site preference motif. It's interesting that the landmark is a railroad track -- the Frisco line -- hovering above the highway. Whatever it's significance as a physical marker, the reference to train tracks conjures up the recurrent image of locomotive travel in blues repertoire. 

A1:If I should die/Baby, before my time ( playing with the sequence be-be -- playful in a way Dylan would pick up on)
A2:If I should die/baby before my time
B:bury my body on 51 highway/just down below the frisco line


A1:Now, Mister Bus Driver/let me ride down in your blinds
A2:Mister Bus Driver/let me ride down in your blinds
B:And if you don't let me ride, man/I'm gonna swing right on behind


In verse 3,which introduces the travel motif, Jones again has trains on his mind. His reference to "your blinds" borrows a term frequently used in relation to hobo train travel to petition a bus driver to waive the fare for some sketchy seating option. The hyperbolic B phrase -- though slyly comic -- imaginatively expresses the singer's desperation and the extreme risks he is willing to take to bum a ride. This is decades before skate boards were invented.




Performance
The vocal phrasing here is remarkable, alternating elongated pleas for forgvieness with rapid staccato admissions of guilt on the A phrases, and another rapid-fire burst of words on the first part of the B phrase ( 13 syllables in two beats!).
