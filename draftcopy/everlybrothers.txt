published in 1957 and became a number one hit -- Dylan probably first heard it in high school



An unprecedented assemblage of country and rock 'n' roll patterns 
Remarkable for the number of distinct sections -- up to 7 5 of which repeated with variation 


despite having been banned from Boston radio stations for lyrics that, at the time, were considered suggestive, according to a 1986 interview with Don Everly.[2] "Wake Up Little Susie" also spent seven weeks atop the Billboard country chart[3] and got to number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked at #318 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[4]

In July, 1968, Bob Dylan was asked to write some songs for the film Midnight Cowboy, but submitted them too late for inclusion.  One of these compositions was "Lay Lady Lay."  In either late 1968 or early 1969, when  the Everly Brothers were playing New York's Bottom Line, Dylan visited backstage. Phil asked if Dylan had any new songs. Dylan picked up a guitar and softly sang "Lay Lady Lay."  The Everly's misheard the lyrics, so Don Everly  declined, saying, "Thank you, it's a great song, but I don't think we could get away with that."  In 1984, after the Everly Brothers reunited, they went into the studio with Dave Edmunds producing, and finally recorded "Lay Lady Lay," on the album, EB '84.   For their next album, Born Yesterday, the Everlys covered Dylan's "Abandoned Love." 


Shared a love of traditional music

"Their unmistakble harmonies drew on 700 years of Scottish borders' misery,transplanted via the Appalachians, to sing out late 1950's teenage confusion" -- Dylan Encyc. pg. 216

Bob Dylan once said: “We owe these guys everything. They started it all.”

Songs Our Daddy Taught Us -- 

Songs Our Daddy Taught Us is the second album by close harmony country/rock and roll duo The Everly Brothers, released in 1958. The album is a selection of songs that the brothers learned as boys from their father, Ike Everly.

Music journalist Richie Unterberger notes that the album of traditional music, released at the peak of the duo's commercial success as a rock and roll act, was unexpected and "ahead of its time".[3] Rolling Stone, which awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars, noted that not even Elvis Presley "had the nerve to do an album as rootsy" as this one.[1]

In April, 1969, Bob Dylan went into Columbia Music Row Studios in Nashville to start recording what turned out to be the 1970 double-album, Self Portrait. Among the songs Dylan tackled at the second and third sessions were a couple associated with the Everly Brothers - "Let It Be Me" and "Take A Message To Mary."  Dylan later revisited "Let It Be Me," in 1981, for a European single B-side.  Also, while jamming with George Harrison on May 1, 1970, Dylan covered "All I Have To Do Is Dream." This Everly Brothers classic may have been the inspiration for Dylan's "Basement Tapes" out-take, "All You Have To Do Is Dream."
