Jazz Gillum's "Good Old 51 Highway" fuses wistfulness and menace. The song is a superb example of the 30's Chicago blues style known as "the Bluebird Beat". Named after Victor's susbidiary blues label, the style combined elements of vaudeville-based classic blues with Mississippi Delta country blues, a fusion ably demonstrated in Gillum's warbling clarinet-like harmonica forays. Gillum delivers a linear narrative and reflects at length on his relationship to his estranged woman. 




my baby worke up this morning    and she said she was highway bound
yes...
she wanted to find number 51     that's the main highway out of town



she wouldn't even talk to me     didn't have a word to say
she asked all her friends        where she could find 51 highway

well i feel like takin may suitcase and sittin' down on that lonesome highway
so if she lives out on highway number 51 i'll overtake her just before day

if i had my machine   i wouldn't worry about her leaving town
cause i'd hit that 51 highway, lord know i'd roll that highway down

Keeping with the urbane patina this blues style promoted, Gillum fashions a retributive lyric that civilizes the "I'm gonna kill my baby if she don't stop cheatin' and lyin" rural common stock lurking beneath the surface. Distracts with cleverness and subtlety from the brutal intent expressed.
