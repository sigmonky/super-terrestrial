I'm gonna get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Miss Fannie Mae my sweet woman and she don't pay me no mind

Yeah she left  this mornin' and she rode that B&O ( humming )
Yes she left me and she rode that B&0 ( whistling )
When she was leavin' (lord, lord, lord ) she wouldn't even -- lord -- shake my hand

Someday I'll meet you when your troubles get like mine....

Hooker's story about "Highway 51" sounds like improvised reportage,
telegraphing themes of travel,estrangement,abandonment and retribution. Emotional neglect -- not passionate pursuit -- leads him down the  asphalt. His lover takes off too, catching a train for destinations and reasons unknown;but the telling detail that she wouldn't even shake the spurned singer's hand might be an unspoken admission that "mistakes were made". Tacit admission of guilt in this case doesn't neccesarily imply remorse. At song's end, Hooker's sneering prediction that she will meet him again "when your troubles get like mine" conveys a desire for retribution, not reconciliation.


Hooker was adept at working without structural nets. Though the lyric AAB form is followed through most the song, it ahderes to no regular metric structure and dispenses with end rhymes.

This dialogue gets particularly rich in the second verse when Hooker complements his guitar lines with unison wordless humming and then whistling. His key structural discipline is the rock solid tempo and groove pumped out with his foot: all seems to flow from there.


The two full verses follow the conventional AAB blues lyric form without end rhymes. The last 
The expressive power of the lyrics is more about the performance than the words
