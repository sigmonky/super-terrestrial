I'm gonna get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Miss Fannie Mae my sweet woman and she don't pay me no mind

Yeah she left  this mornin' and she rode that B&O ( humming )
Yes she left me and she rode that B&0 ( whistling )
When she was leavin' (lord, lord, lord ) she wouldn't even -- lord -- shake my hand

Someday I'll meet you when your troubles get like mine....

The lyrics to John Lee Hooker's Highway 51 comprise a completely original song composed entirely of stock blues phrases. In this riveting solo performance, nothing, yet everything, everything is new. Hooker was an expert stream-of-conciousness performer and it's likely this recording was improvised on the spot. 


Like other performers in this playlist, Hooker covers some common themes asociated with the Highway 51 topic in his own way. Here both Hooker and his estranged lover have hit the road with no destination indicated: Hooker chooses to go down Highway 51 while his woman takes a train. Hooker provides concise detail of ways his lover has shunned him and expresses no interest in getting back together. His sardonic prediction that she will meet him again "when your troubles get like mine" at the song's end sounds more like retribution than reconcilation.
