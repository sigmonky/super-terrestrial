I'm gonna get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Miss Fannie Mae my sweet woman and she don't pay me no mind

Yeah she left  this mornin' and she rode that B&O ( humming )
Yes she left me and she rode that B&0 ( whistling )
When she was leavin' (lord, lord, lord ) she wouldn't even -- lord -- shake my hand

Someday I'll meet you when your troubles get like mine....

Hooker's lyrics on his version of "Highway 51" sound like improvised, stream-of-conciousness reportage,
covering travel,estrangement,abandonment and retribution with a few fragmentary details. Emotional neglect -- not pursuit -- leads him down the  asphalt. His lover takes off too, catching a train for destinations and reasons unknown;but the telling detail that she wouldn't even shake the spurned singer's hand might be an unspoken admission that he made some serious mistakes. Admission of guilt in this case doesn't neccesarily imply remorse. At song's end, Hooker's sneering prediction that she will meet him again "when your troubles get like mine" conveys a desire for retribution not reconciliation.

The two full verses follow the conventional AAB blues lyric form without end rhymes. The expressive power of the lyrics is more about the performance than the words
