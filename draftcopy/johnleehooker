Lyrics

I'm gonna get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Miss Fannie Mae my sweet woman and she don't pay me no mind

Yeah she left  this mornin' and she rode that B&O ( humming )
Yes she left me and she rode that B&0 ( whistling )
When she was leavin' (lord, lord, lord ) she wouldn't even -- lord -- shake my hand

Someday I'll meet you when your troubles get like mine....


In John Lee Hooker's version of "Highway 51", the narrator presents himself as a spurned lover who takes to the road in frustration. His lover also takes off, catching a train in a presumably opposite direction. Her reason for leaving is unknown but the telling detail that she wouldn't even shake the singer's hand leads the listener to question who is being abused here. At song's end, his sardonic prediction that she will meet him again "when your troubles get like mine" suggests a desire for retribution rather than reconciliation.

These lyrics have a stream-of-conciousness, reportage quality and were likely improvised on the spot. Hooker succeeds in presenting a rich emotional weave of estrangement, abandonment, and retribution with just a few fragmentary details.
