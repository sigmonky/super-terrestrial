I'm gonna get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Get up in the mornin' goin' down highway 51
Miss Fannie Mae my sweet woman and she don't pay me no mind

Yeah she left  mornin' and she rode that B&O ( humming )
Yes she left me and she rode that B&0 ( whistling )
When she was leavin' (lord, lord, lord ) she wouldn't even -- lord -- shake my hand

Someday I'll meet you when your troubles get like mine....
