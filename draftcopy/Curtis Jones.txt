Curtis Jones

Highway 51 was credited to Curtis Jones on "Bob Dylan". What's curious about this is that Dylan's version bears no significant resemblance to Jones' '38 contribution recorded for Vocalion:both lyrics and musical arrangment are vastly different. I haven't found any convincing explanation for this attribution. Maybe Dylan misinformed Columbia. Maybe Columbia had an interest in the publishing company. Honest mistake?


Lyrics

These lyrics have several features characteristic of Dylan's work:rhythmically complex phrasing, a collage narrative that tells a story without reliance on narration sequence,and deft usage of consonance,assonance, and alliteration. While Dylan and McClennan start off in hot pursuit of a love interest, Jones opens with a plea to an estranged lover for forgiveness -- perhaps only to avoid retribution:

A1:Forgive me /honey for all the wrong I've done
A2:Please forgive me/honey for all the wrong I've done
B:I don't want nobody have to (be) comin' for me/ whilst(?) out on highway 51


Verse 2 deals with the premature death/burial site motif: 

A1:If I should die/Baby, before my time ( playing with the sequence be-be -- playful in a way Dylan would pick up on)
A2:If I should die/baby before my time
B:bury my body on 51 highway/just down below the frisco line

The "frisco line" refers to a train track and creates associations with another prevalent form of travel in blue songs.

In verse 3, Jones is trying to freeload a bus ride, modifying a train travel scenario frequently narrated by blues singers:

A1:Now, Mister Bus Driver/let me ride down in your blinds
A2:Mister Bus Driver/let me ride down in your blinds
B:And if you don't let me ride, man/I'm gonna swing right on behind

His reference to "your blinds" borrows a term typically used in relation to hobo train travel to petition the bus driver to waive the bus fare and allow a penniless itinerant a covert,sketchy seating option. Such dialogs typically end with the driver telling the freeloader he can't do it. Here, the B phrase gives the narrator the last word, both resolute and desparate. 

Abruptly moving from desperation to largesse, Jones in verse 4 offers opulent assylum to a woman fleeing her unhinged boyfriend:

A1:Baby if your good man get buggy/ Don't want you to have no fun
A2:If your man get buggy, Baby/Don't want you to have no fun
B:Come and follow me to my mansion/that's down on highway 51

 McClennan also has a similar verse in his "New Highway 51". "Buggy" -- a synonym for crazy -- is perhpas a pun on yet another mode of transportation. Another remarkable feature of this verse is its ingenious use of compound, enveloped, alliteration with a pair of B's wrapping a pair of G's:
 
 Baby if your Good man Get Buggy

 ... and the "B" words provide an internal rhyme with their assonant "eeee" endings, wrapping the whole sub-phrase in an internal rhyme.

 Jones uses collage rather than linear logic to sequence the lyrics but the overall flow feels more deliberate than spontaneous. As with McClennan, Highway 51 is simultaneously a road (and specifically a means of escape), a home (in this case a mansion), and a grave. 

 Me and My Baby/We walked 51 Highway  side by side
 Me and My little baby/ walked the highway side by side
 If we should have a bad accident, won't nobody know the death we died






Performance

Jones performance is characteristic of urban blues with its strict adherence to the 4/4 12-bar blues form througout. But he brilliantly plays against this predictable regularity with wild polyrhythmic excursions in both piano and vocal phrasing. His vocal flights are particularly remarkable. For example in the first part of the B section of verse 1 we have:

"I don't want nobody have to come a-here for me"

...that's thirteen syllables evenly spaced and packed into two and a half beats -- a tricky 13:5 polyrhythm. This is a challenge to sing and hard to compose. And he's accompanying himself with an independent ryhthm in his right hand and holding down the bass line in his left.

Suffice to say, Jones was an excellent piano player. His high,spectral tenor voice and somewhat unusual choice of minor key  add immensely to the tune's sustained spooky mood. This is certainly a travel song, and - despite all the terrestrial vehicles references - it feels like an out of body experience.
