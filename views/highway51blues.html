          A term coined by author Greil Marcus to describe the relentlessly spooky American roots music on the legendary <a href='http://www.folkways.si.edu/explore_folkways/anthologyfolk.aspx' target='_blank'>Anthology of American Folk Music</a> compiled by hermetecist Harry Smith with the express intent of transmuting leaden 50's pop culture into gold. The recording was a key inspiration for the Greenwich Village folk revival and Dylan was no doubt influenced by it. Marcus originally used the term for an essay title in the booklet accompanying the '97 CD box set re-issue of the anthology. He later used it as the title for a <a href='http://blogcritics.org/book-review-the-old-weird-america/' target='_blank'>book</a> on the secret music made by Bob Dylan and the Band while in seclusion in Woodstock, New York, in 1967, some of which was later released as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basement_Tapes' target='_blank'>'The Basement Tapes'</a>.

                      Several blues recordings about Highway 51 had been released by the time Dylan recorded "Highway 51 Blues" for his 1962 debut album, "Bob Dylan". Blues resarcher Paul Oliver provides this:

                      On his "Highway 51",Dylan integrates blues and rockabilly influences and probably contributes one original verse. The others were borrowed most likely from Tommy McClennan. It is both ironic and  prescient -- given the long-standing debate over whether Dylan's magpie proclivities constitute art or shoplifting -- that the album credits Curtis Jones as the song's composer when Dylan's version is neither based on nor borrows from it. Like most of the "Bob Dylan" album -- largely a collection of rugged, distinctive interpretations of traditional blues and American folk songs -- "Highway 51" is a energetic harbinger of the

                          <h3>Overview</h3>
                          Though steeped in folk music from his late teens,Dylan never entirely lost interest in r&b and rock-n-roll. His debut record came out a few years after his scandalous Little Richard-inspired Hibbing High talent show gig in '56, perhaps the first rock performance where an instrument was (nearly) destroyed on stage. As early Dylan champion Robert Shelton notes:
                        </p>
                        <div class="well">
                          <em>
                           "In his first year around the (Greenwich) Village, Dylan insisted he was a country or rockabilly singer, or just a singer— but not a folk singer. “Highway 51” may be the first folk-rock recording, even without electric instruments or rhythm section...here are all the elements of folk-rock without electrification."
                          </em>
                        </div>
                        <h3>General Approach</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          Adapting a tactic from the Elvis Presley playbook, Dylan takes a Mississippi delta blues tune and gives it a fernetic rockabilly makeover. Presley's approach to <a href="spotify:track:5IM3mYyWYsKUSukMGYYq1U">Arthur Crudup's "That's Alright,Mama" </a>on his <a href="spotify:track:4O958xeV2blAhD95Qo24nc">legendary Sun Records debut session</a> is significantly different from Dylan's re-paving of Highway 51 here. Where Presley's interpretation simmers, Dylan's boils over. The guitar part is a faster version of the signature guitar riff heard on the Everly Brothers '57 hit "Wake Up Little Susie" and later is heard with substantial alterations in the Dylan original "That's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding". The liner notes to "Bob Dylan" allude to this musical borrowing:"the diesel-tempoed Highway 51 is of a type sung by the Everly Brothers, partially rewritten by Dylan".
                        </div>
                        <h3>The voice</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">

                          In an earnest,resourceful effort to synthesize his varied influences, Dylan combines blues-inflected raspiness and an indeterminate hillbilly drawl to concoct "a determined, iconoclastic baying that chews up influences, and spits out the odd mixed signal without half trying", as music critic Tim Riley puts it. Whether deliberate or happenstance, he's not so much imitiating his vocal precedents as twisting the elements he likes to fit his own capabilities and intentions. 

                        </div>      

                        <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">

                          <p>
                            Dylan borrows some verses for this version and perhaps adds some new materaial as well. Verses 1 and 3 most likely come from Tommy McClennan's "New Highway 51" recorded in 1940 for the Bluebird Label and are discussed in the Tommy McClennan section below. "New Highway 51" was re-issued on the 1960 compilation "The Rural Blues:A Study of the Vocal and Instrumental Resources", which Dylan was surely aware of. But whether Dylan heard these verses via re-issue, original 78, or from other performers is anyone's guess. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Verse 2,on the other hand,is either really obscure or a Dylan original that is idiomatic,deft and loosely autobiographical:
                          </p>
                          <p class="well">
                            <em>
                              Well, I know that highway like I know my hand<br/>
                              Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand<br/>
                              Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
                            </em>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Wisconsin borders Dylan's home state of Minnesota and is the northern terminus of Highway 51. The three-syllable state name phrases better than Minnesota and allows Dylan to simultaneously reveal and cover his tracks. Characterstically Dylanesque, the destination "no man's land" adroitly detours the listener's expectation of definite location to an ambiguous,contested territory fraught with danger. The verse also provides a convincing segue into Dylan's ruminations on premature death in verse 3.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                          It's an open question why Curtis Jones was given songwriting credits on Dylan's debut album: Jones's spectral,elegant "Highway 51 Blues" -- though addressing the same topics in vaguely similar ways -- bears little resemblance to the Dylan version in either performance style or lyrics.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                         <h3>Musical Form and Performance Characteristics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                         
                         <p>
                          Dylan explicitly covers the recurring topics of pursuit and death in his lyrics but doesn't mention means of travel. His relentlessly percussive guitar part effectively suggests the roar of a revving combustion engine sans muffler, becoming both proxy vehicle and background chorus. Little Richard - an early Dylan influence -- would be a likely inspiration for its manic intensity; I also hear some affinity between the hypnotic ferocity of Leadbelly's guitar arragement on "Gallis Pole" and the mood and intensity of Dylan's part if not their respective technical specifics. 
                        </p>
                         <p>
                         Like rural blues performers, Dylan loosely references the the conventional 12-bar blues form, opting for a fluid conversation between voice and guitar. His hurtling joyride  down Highway 51 does consistently follow the common AAB blues lyric form, end-rhymes and all. Dylan pares down the chord progression to I-IV-I-V-I in all verses. While sticking to this progression in every verse,chord changes happen at will, ignore all traffic lights and occassionally weave into the opposite lane.

                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Verses 1 and 2 of this recording made by McLennan and an unknown upright bass player on May 10, 1940 in Chicago for the Bluebird label are identical to verses 1 and 3 in Dylan's version. The song was re-issued on the important 1960 compilation "The Rural Blues:A Study of the Vocal and Instrumental Resources" so there is good likelihood that Dylan heard the 78, the LP, or picked it up from other performers who knew McClennan's version. 
                      </p>
                      <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Beyond the interstates, older highways still do -- as McClennan relates in verse 1 -- "run right by" people's houses.
                        Here is the first time the singer uses a synecdoche ( door ) to setup a rhyme with the last word in the verse ( more ). Hot pursuit of a lover starts on a defeatist note. This intensifies in verse 2 to speculation about a fatal end to his pursuit and the desire to be buried near his unrequited love interest in that event.
                      </p>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Covering the travel motif in verse 3, McLennan's  "Greyhound Bus" reference to the iconic bus company logo  with its "tongue sticking on the side" compactly symbolizes the singer's panting urgency to get to his woman. McClennan again uses a synechdoche to set up a rhyme with the last word in the verse (ride ). All in all, pretty "Dylanesque"...no?
                      </p>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Verse 5 provides a happy, albeit ambiguous,ending . The singer's "cabin" out on highway 51 suggests that he is either re-united with his lover or made suitable alternate arrangements while pursuing her. In either case, his invitation to shindig hardly sounds like he's settled down.
                      </p>

                        McLennan's robust gravelly voice is complemented by his percussive guitar style that alternates insistent, quarter-beat, chordal strumming with taut single-note figures, suggesting the respective roles of rock-steady kick and the chattering, syncopated snare of a bebop drummer. He effortlessly maintains a sinuous, highly variable accompaniment that simulataneously challenges and complements his vocal phrasing -- a tour-de-force example of rhythmic indepdence between voice and fingers ( and foot for that matter). It grooves convincingly at a tempo considerably slower than Dylan's rockabilly joyride. McClennan uses the conventional 12-bar blues form as a reference point but isn't bound to it. The lively dialog between voice and guitar benefits from this freedom and the bass player has no trouble navigating the current.

                        A gravel-throated back-country blues growler from the Mississippi Delta, Tommy McClennan was part of the last wave of down-home blues guitarists to record for the major labels in Chicago. His rawboned 1939-1942 Bluebird recordings were no-frills excursions into the blues bottoms. He left a powerful legacy that included "Bottle It Up and Go," "Cross Cut Saw Blues," "Deep Blue Sea Blues" (aka "Catfish Blues"), and others whose lasting power has been evidenced through the repertoires and re-recordings of other artists. Admirers of McClennan's blues would do well to check out the 1941-1942 Bluebird sessions of Robert Petway, a McClennan associate who performed in a similar but somewhat more lyrical vein. McClennan never recorded again and reportedly died a destitute alcoholic in Chicago; blues researchers have been unable to confirm the date or circumstances of his death.

                        <h3>Connection To Dylan's Version</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                        Curtis Jones "Highway 51 Blues",recorded in 1938 for the Vocalion label, was the source Dylan credited on his release. Though addressing the same topics,these two versions are not otherwise remotely similar. 
                        </div>

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                          <div class="txtFormat">
                            <p>
                              While Dylan and McClennan open with hot pursuit of a love interest, Jones considers escape -- he's the hunted, not the hunter. His trembling alto keens convincingly when petitioning "forgive me" for wrongdoing and then registers palpable anxiety
                              about a violent avenger at the end of verse 1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Verse 2</strong> deals with premature death and burial, opening wth a phrase similar to the one heard in  McClennan's version. But here death may not end the sojourn.Jones request that he be buried beneath train tracks suggests there will be scores to settle in an afterlife where he will reamin a fugitive. 
                            </p>
                             <p>
                              In <strong>verse 3</strong>, he tries to freeload a bus ride. His request to ride "the blinds" smartly refashions a stock blues motif where the penniless would-be passenger petitions a train engineer or conductor for a free ride in a covert, dangerous section of the locomotive but is denied passage. Here Jones pre-empts the bus driver's anticipated response with the resolution to "swing right on behind" if refused. This is decades before skate boards or roller blades so it's hard to guess what form of travel he's talking about, but the phrase ably conveys his desperation to make a quick getaway however dangerous. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Abruptly moving from desperation to what seems like hallucinatory largesse, <strong>verse 4</strong> finds Jones offering comfortable assylum to a woman fleeing her unhinged boyfriend in the singer's "mansion" on the highway. This is formally similar to McClennan's last verse but, keeping with the escape theme here, it's about asylum rather than pleasure.
                              In a song liberally festooned with artful consances, assonances, and internal rhyme schemes, this particular phrase from verse 4 is a standout:                             
                            </p>
                            <p class="well">
                              <em>
                                BaBy if your Good man Get BuGGY
                              </em>
                            </p>
                            <p>.... and also puns on yet another form of travel in this anxiously peripatetic song.

                            <p>
                              Jones snaps out of his reverie in <strong>verse 5</strong>. He wistfully recalls he and his woman walking together down Highway 51 in the A lines but then answers in the B line with future-tense speculation of their unreported death in a bad accident. 
                            </p>

                            Jones brilliantly plays with and against the disicplined precision of his band  -- who adhere strictly to the 12-bar blues form -- with wild polyrhythmic excursions in both piano and vocal phrasing. He was a superb blues piano player and a master of rhythmic independence. His high,spectral voice and somewhat unusual choice of minor key add immensely to the tune's sustained spooky mood.

                          Jazz Gillum's "Good Old 51 Highway"  has no discernible direct connection to Dylan's version. It's another great example of how blues artists can fashion new stories from a reservoir of related stock topics and associated sub-themes. Like much of Dylan's work, Gillum's tune qualifies as an original work while freely drawing from a catalog of pre-existent narrative elements.

                        <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            More than any other lyrics in this playlist, Gillum's display careful linear development, covering the common themes of estranged love, means of travel, destitution, and death in a highly original way. It provides a kind of prequel to the Dylan and McClennan versions, detailing the departure of the singer's lover.Without identifying what caused the estrangement, verse 2 compounds the qualified suggestion of Gillum's bewilderment in verse 1 with the sting of public humiliation: she refuses to talk to him and asks her friends for directions to the highway. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This is also the only rendition in the playlist where the narrator is going nowwhere.
                            The proposed means of travel for pursuit introduced in Verse 3 is an unenthusiastic fantasy about hitch-hiking, suggesting that the singer is broke. Verse 4 expands on this feeling of frustrated indolence and charts its progression to violent yet impotent rage. The "machine" he doesn't have suggests a few things at once: a gun ( a machine gun perhaps), an automobile (or maybe evan a steamroller), and a properly functioning penis. Regarding the premature death theme, Gillum doesn't ruminate on his own demise: it's those who've crossed him who get "mowed down".

                            As the moniker "Jazz" would suggest, Gillum was influenced by current popular music. There are certainly precedents for his understated, slightly nasal vocal style in  earlier Mississippi delta blues. If he was also aspiring to a current jazz vocal style, it would be the honeyed nonchalant yawn of Jack Teagarden and not Louis Armstrong's outgoing energetic grit.

                            His expert falsetto harmonica lines wistfully poise contemporary jazz trumpet and clarinet influences on a firm foundation of southern rural blues and string band harmonica conventions.

                            "Good Old Highway 51" was recorded in June of 1938 with Big Bill Broonzy on guitar, Washboard Sam on washboard, and unknown standup bass. It is a smooth, jazzy, and  accomplished performance that understates without obscuring delta blues udercurrents. One hears a deliberate effort to conform to contemporary popular music conventions -- regulated song structure throughout, crisp unobtrusive accompaniment, and pre-meditated intros and outros. While this assimilation of popular songwriting conventions is often understood as reflecting an "upwardly mobile" cultrual aspiration, it may be little more than a packaging tactic,a dependable production method for realizing a recorded product with mass appeal in a predictable amount of time for a predictable amount of dollars.

                          Hooker's "Highway 51" sounds like improvised reportage,
                          telegraphing themes of travel,estrangement,abandonment and retribution. Emotional neglect rather than hot pusuit leads him down the  asphalt. His lover takes off too, catching a train for destinations and reasons unknown. In verse 2, the telling detail that, on departure, she wouldn't even shake her spurned lover's might be his unspoken admission that "mistakes were made". Guilt in this case doesn't neccesarily imply remorse. At song's end, Hooker's sneering prediction that they will meet again "when your troubles get like mine" is about  retribution, not reconciliation.

                        <h3>Performance Characteristics</h3>
                      
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            Hooker was a fearless adept at performing without a structural net. Though the lyric AAB form  in Highway 51 is followed through most the song, it ahderes to no regular metric structure and dispenses with end rhymes. As with many solo blues performers, form follows unmetered antiphonal dialogue between voice and instrument. This dialogue gets particularly rich in the second verse when Hooker complements his guitar lines, answering the vocals with unison humming and whistling. The single line third verse sounds deliberate, not incomplete. His key structural discipline is the rock solid tempo and groove pumped out with his foot: all the free energy roiling in this performance flows from that. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There is an understandable but hobbling tendency for reviewers to reductively characterize Hooker's style as raw and primitive. Michael Gray provides a nuanced case for this characterization and its contrary, describing Hooker's performance  approach as a "shambling style that seemed as old as voodoo chants yet always managed to sound modern and knowing" (encyc page 328).
                          </p>

                        <h3>Connections to Dylan</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            One of Dylan's first big breaks was a billing as Hooker's opening act for two weeks in April 1961 at Gerde's Folk City, a mainstay of the Greenwich Village folk music scene . Dylan's friend Sybil Weinberger said that "Dylan loved Hooker and that whenever he was playng, Bob would there" (Gray, encyc 329). Hooker had this to say about Dylan in 1985:
                            "I met him when I was playing in the coffeehouses. He wasn't famous then but he came by to see me. We played some shows together and he'd come back to my place and we'd stay up all night playin' and drinkin' wine." (Gray, encyc 329) Though Dylan's version of "Highway 51" bears no obvious resemblance to Hooker's, the bluesman's elastic approach to form may have rubbed off on Dylan during those all-night jams.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There was a professional connection too: both Dylan and Hooker were managed by Albert Grossman, the shrewd, hard-nosed businessman credited with enabling Dylan's tremendous commercial success in the 1960's.
