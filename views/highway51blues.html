          A term coined by author Greil Marcus to describe the relentlessly spooky American roots music on the legendary <a href='http://www.folkways.si.edu/explore_folkways/anthologyfolk.aspx' target='_blank'>Anthology of American Folk Music</a> compiled by hermetecist Harry Smith with the express intent of transmuting leaden 50's pop culture into gold. The recording was a key inspiration for the Greenwich Village folk revival and Dylan was no doubt influenced by it. Marcus originally used the term for an essay title in the booklet accompanying the '97 CD box set re-issue of the anthology. He later used it as the title for a <a href='http://blogcritics.org/book-review-the-old-weird-america/' target='_blank'>book</a> on the secret music made by Bob Dylan and the Band while in seclusion in Woodstock, New York, in 1967, some of which was later released as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basement_Tapes' target='_blank'>'The Basement Tapes'</a>.

                      Several blues recordings about Highway 51 had been released by the time Dylan recorded "Highway 51 Blues" for his 1962 debut album "Bob Dylan". Blues resarcher Paul Oliver provides this:

                    Each song in this playlist presents the narrator either pursuing or escaping from his lover. Other recurrent topics are means of travel, death, and burial arrangments. While the singers confine themselves to a common set of topics, their musical and lyrical renderings are very different.

                      On his "Highway 51",Dylan integrates blues and rockabilly influences and possibly contributes one original verse. The others were borrowed most likely from Tommy McClennan. It is ironic -- given the controversy around Dylan's unattributed borrowing from other sources -- that the album credits Curtis Jones as the song's composer: Dylan's version is obviously neither based on nor borrows from it. Like most of the "Bob Dylan" album -- largely a collection of rugged, idiosyncratic interpretations of traditional blues and American folk songs -- it is a likeable,if not fully-baked, harbinger of the

                          <h3>Overview</h3>
                          Though steeped in folk music from his late teens,Dylan never entirely lost interest in r&b and rock-n-roll. His debut record came out a few years after his scandalous Little Richard-inspired Hibbing High talent show gig in '56, perhaps the first rock performance where an instrument was (nearly) destroyed on stage. As early Dylan champion Robert Shelton notes:
                        </p>
                        <div class="well">
                          <em>
                           "In his first year around the Village (i.e. Greenwich Village in Manhattan), Dylan insisted he was a country or rockabilly singer, or just a singer— but not a folk singer. “Highway 51” may be the first folk-rock recording, even without electric instruments or rhythm section...here are all the elements of folk-rock without electrification."
                          </em>
                        </div>
                        <h3>General Approach</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          Adapting one from the Elvis Presley playbook, Dylan takes a Mississippi delta blues tune and gives it a nervous rockabilly makeover. Presley's approach to <a href="spotify:track:5IM3mYyWYsKUSukMGYYq1U">Arthur Crudup's "That's Alright,Mama" </a>on his <a href="spotify:track:4O958xeV2blAhD95Qo24nc">legendary Sun Records debut session</a> is significantly different from Dylan's re-paving of Highway 51. Where Presley's interpretation simmers, Dylan's boils over. The guitar part is a sped-up version of the signature guitar riff heard on the Everly Brothers '57 hit "Wake Up Little Susie" and also reappears with substantial alterations in the Dylan original "That's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding". The liner notes to "Bob Dylan" allude to this musical borrowing:"the diesel-tempoed Highway 51 is of a type sung by the Everly Brothers, partially rewritten by Dylan".
                        </div>
                        <h3>The voice</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          In an earnest,resourceful effort to come to terms with his varied influences, Dylan combines blues-inflected raspiness and an indeterminate hillbilly drawl to concoct "a determined, iconoclastic baying that chews up influences, and spits out the odd mixed signal without half trying", as music critic Tim Riley puts it. Whether deliberate or happenstance, he's not so much imitiating his influences as adapting what he likes to his rough-hewn,idiosyncratic chops and expansive creative intentions. 
                        </div>      

                        <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>Verses 1 and 3 most likely come from Tommy McClennan's "New Highway 51" recorded in 1940 for the Bluebird Label and are discussed in the lyrics subsection of the Tommy McClennan discussion below. McClennan's recording was re-issued on the 1960 compilation "The Rural Blues:A Study of the Vocal and Instrumental Resources". Whether Dylan heard this via re-issue, original 78, or from other performers is anyone's guess. Verse 2,on the other hand,is either really obscure or a Dylan original that is idiomatic,deft and loosely autobiographical:
                          </p>
                          <p class="well">
                            <em>
                              Well, I know that highway like I know my hand<br/>
                              Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand<br/>
                              Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
                            </em>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Wisconsin borders Dylan's home state of Minnesota and is the northern terminus of Highway 51. The three-syllable state name phrases better than Minnesota and allows Dylan to simultaneously reveal and cover his tracks. Characterstically Dylanesque, the destination "no man's land" cleverly detours the listener's expectation of definite location to an ambiguous,contested territory fraught with danger.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                          It's an open question why Curtis Jones was given songwriting credits on Dylan's debut album: Jones's spectral,elegant "Highway 51 Blues" -- though addressing the same topics in vaguely similar ways -- bears little resemblance to the Dylan version in either performance style or lyrics.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                         <h3>Musical Form and Performance Characteristics</h3>

                         <p>
                          Dylan explicitly covers pursuit and death in his lyrics but doesn't mention means of travel. Instead, his relentlessly percussive guitar part effectively suggests the roar of a revving combustion engine sans muffler, becoming both proxy vehicle (a triumph spitfire perhaps) and background chorus. I hear the hypnotic ferocity of Leadbelly's guitar part on <a href="spotify:track:1xXhyZwfwp4zJVkMBFLo3k">Gallis Poll</a> as an inspriation for the part's mood and intensity if not its technical specifics, but that's just plausible fantasy.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                         Dylan evokes rural blues performance practice in his approach to song structure:he ignores the conventional 12-bar, 4/4 blues form, opting for a fluid conversation between voice and guitar. His hurtling joyride  down Highway 51 does consistently follow the common AAB blues lyric form, end-rhymes and all. Dylan pares down the chord progression to I-IV-I-V-I in all verses. While sticking to this progression throughout,chord changes happen at will, ignore all traffic lights and occassionally weave into the opposite lane.

                       <h3>Connection to Dylan's Version</h3>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Dylan could have taken verses 1 and 2 from this recording made by McLennan and an unknown upright bass player on May 10, 1940 in Chicago for the Bluebird label. It's possible that it was available on LP in '62  or Dylan could have heard it on a 78. Dylan got verses 1 and 3 of his version from somewhere.
                      </p>
                      <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        McClennan covers unrequited love in verse 1 and death/burial arrangments in verse 2 with the same lyrics heard in the Dylan version. Verse 1 locates his lover on the side of Highway 51 but she's either left home or McClennan doesn't have an exact address. In either case, it frustrates pursuit of her, his only reason for living. In verse 2, lovesick obsession provides the rationale for McClennan's request to be buried on Highway 51 in the event of premature death. He would presumably live to a ripe old age and die of natural causes if he could just re-unite with his lover.

                      </p>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Covering the travel motif in verse 3,McLennan's  "Greyhound Bus" reference is noteworthy for its artful synecdoche describing the iconic bus company logo -- a "tongue sticking on the side" -- that compactly symbolizes the singer's panting urgency to get to his woman. If Dylan heard McClennan's version, it's puzzling that he wouldn't use this verse. How could Dylan pass on such a "Dylanesque" phrase?
                      </p>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        As is common in blues, McClennan uses collage rather than linear narrative to organize his impressions, quite possibly improvising on the spot. But -- thanks to McClennan's convincing delivery --  the listener has no trouble accepting that Highway 51 is at once a road, a happy home, and a graveyard.
                      </p>
                       <h3>Musical Form and Performance Characteristics</h3>

                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        McLennan's robust gravelly voice is complemented by his percussive guitar style that alternates insistent, quarter-beat, strumming with razor-sharp single-note figures, suggesting the respective roles of rock-steady kick and chattering snare drums in a conventional trap set. He effortlessly maintains a sinuous, highly variable accompaniment that simulataneously challenges and complements his vocal phrasing -- a tour-de-force example of rhythmic indepdence between voice and fingers ( and foot for that matter). It grooves convincingly at a tempo considerably slower than Dylan's rockabilly joyride and is energized by multiple layers of implied polyrhythm. McClennan uses the conventional 12-bar blues form as a reference point but isn't bound to it. The lively dialog between voice and guitar benefits greatly from this elastic approach to song form and the bass player manages to hang in.

                        <h3>Connection To Dylan's Version</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                        Dylan's version of "Highway 51 Blues" on his debut album was credited to bluesman Curtis Jones, who did record a song with this title in 1938 for the Vocalion label. The two versions -- though addressing the same topics -- are not otherwise remotely similar, so one can only speculate why Columbia thought it was obliged to list Jones as songwriter. 
                        </div>

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                          <div class="txtFormat">
                            <p>
                              While Dylan and McClennan open with hot pursuit of a love interest, Jones starts with a plea for forgiveness. It sounds achingly heartfelt but Jones only states that he is trying to avoid retribution. In this travelogue, the narrator is not the hunter but the prey.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Verse 2</strong> deals with the premature death/burial site motif and indicates train tracks -- "the Frisco line" -- as the singer's gravesite landmark. The juxtaposition of final resting place with elevated train tracks subtly alludes to the heaven-bound train of newly departed saved souls prevalent in gospel music lyrics of the period. 
                            </p>
                             <p>
                              In <strong>verse 3</strong>, Jones tries to freeload a bus ride. His request of the driver to ride "the blinds" smartly refashions a stock motif where the impvoverished would-be passenger petitions a train engineer or conductor for a free ride in a covert, dangerous section of the train but is denied passage. Here Jones pre-empts the bus driver's anticipated response with the resolution to "swing right on behind" if he can't board. This is decades before skate boards or roller blades so it's hard to guess what form of travel he's talking about, but the phrase does effectively express his determination to ride the bus by whatever means neccessary, however dangerous. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Abruptly moving from desperation to largesse, <strong>verse 4</strong> finds Jones offering comfortable assylum to a woman fleeing her unhinged boyfriend in the singer's mansion on the highway. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Jones segues back to despair in <strong>verse 5</strong>. He wistfully recalls he and his woman walking together down Highway 51 in the A lines but then answers in the B line with future-tense speculation of their unreported death in a bad accident. 
                            </p>
                           
                            <p>
                              Notable throughout the lyrics is the skillful use of consonance, assonance, alliteration, internal rhyme, and judicious placement of some phrasing pyrotechnics. As an example of the latter, in the verse 1 B phrase we have:
                            </p>
                            <p class="well">
                              <em>
                                "I don't want nobody have to come a-here for me"
                              </em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              ...that's thirteen syllables evenly spaced and packed into two and a half quarter-note notes or 10 sixteenth notes-- a difficult 13:10 polyrhythm. And, while singing this tricky phrase, he's accompanying himself with an independent ryhthm in his right hand and holding down the bass line in his left on the piano.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              The verse 4 A1 phrase delivers this ingenious Chinese box of phonics:
                            </p>

                            <p class="well">

                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Starting from the endpoints, there is an internal rhyme between "Baby" and "Buggy" as well as consonance. The endpoints wrap another consonance between "Good" and "Get", which is also echoed in the end-word "buggy". In addition to intricate sound design, "buggy" puns on yet another means of travel.

                            Jones brilliantly plays against the disicplined precision of his band  -- who adhere strictly to the 12-bar blues form -- with wild polyrhythmic excursions in both piano and vocal phrasing. He was a superb blues piano player and a master of rhythtmic independence. His high,spectral tenor voice and somewhat unusual choice of minor key  add immensely to the tune's sustained spooky mood.

                           The lyrics are both earthy and other-wordly. This is a travel song that incants re-invented folklore to quietly transport the listener to some obscure, dark region of the astral plane.

                          Jazz Gillum's "Good Old 51 Highway"  has no discernible direct connection to Dylan's version. It's another great example of how blues artists can fashion new stories from a reservoir of related stock topics and associated sub-themes. Like much of Dylan's work, Gillum's tune qualifies as an original work while freely drawing from a catalog of well-known traditional blues narrative elements.

                        <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            More than any other lyrics in this playlist, Gillum's display careful linear development, covering the common themes of estranged love, means of travel, destitution, and death in a highly original way. It provides a kind of prequel to the Dylan and McClennan versions, detailing the departure of the singer's lover.Without identifying what caused the estrangement, verse 2 compounds the qualified suggestion of Gillum's bewilderment in verse 1 with the sting of public humiliation: she refuses to talk to him and asks her friends for directions to the highway. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This is also the only rendition in the playlist where the narrator is going nowwhere.
                            The proposed means of travel for pursuit introduced in Verse 3 is an unenthusiastic fantasy about hitch-hiking, suggesting that the singer is broke. Verse 4 expands on this feeling of frustrated indolence and charts its progression to violent yet impotent rage. The "machine" he doesn't have suggests a few things at once: a gun ( a machine gun perhaps), an automobile or maybe evan a steamroller, and a properly functioning penis. Regarding the premature death theme, Gillum doesn't ruminate on his own demise: it's those who've crossed him who will get "mowed down".

                          <p>
                            As the moniker "Jazz" would suggest, Gillum was influenced by current popular music. There are certainly precedents for his understated, slightly nasal vocal style in  earlier Mississippi delta blues. If he was also aspiring to a current jazz vocal style, it would be the honeyed nonchalant yawn of a Jack Teagarden and not Louis Armstrong's outgoing energetic grit.

                            His expert falsetto harmonica lines wistfully poise contemporary jazz trumpet and clarinet influences on a firm foundation of southern rural blues and string band harmonica conventions.

                            "Good Old Highway 51" was recorded in June of 1938 with Big Bill Broonzy on guitar, Washboard Sam on washboard, and unknown standup bass. It is a smooth, jazzy, and  accomplished performance that understates without obscuring delta blues udercurrents. One hears a deliberate effort to conform to contemporary popular music conventions -- regulated song structure throughout, crisp unobtrusive accompaniment, and pre-meditated intros and outros. While this assimilation of popular songwriting conventions is often understood as reflecting an "upwardly mobile" cultrual aspiration, it may be little more than a packaging tactic,a dependable production method for realizing a recorded product with mass appeal in a predictable amount of time.

                          Hooker's "Highway 51" sounds like improvised reportage,
                          telegraphing themes of travel,estrangement,abandonment and retribution. Emotional neglect rather than hot pusuit leads him down the  asphalt. His lover takes off too, catching a train for destinations and reasons unknown. In verse 2, the telling detail that, on departure, she wouldn't even shake her spurned lover's might be his unspoken admission that "mistakes were made". Guilt in this case doesn't neccesarily imply remorse. At song's end, Hooker's sneering prediction that they will meet again "when your troubles get like mine" is more about  retribution than reconciliation.

                        <h3>Performance Characteristics</h3>
                      
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            Hooker was a fearless adept at performing without a structural net. Though the lyric AAB form  in Highway 51 is followed through most the song, it ahderes to no regular metric structure and dispenses with end rhymes. As with many solo blues performers, form follows unmetered antiphonal dialogue between voice and instrument. This dialogue gets particularly rich in the second verse when Hooker complements his guitar lines, answering the vocals with unison humming and whistling. The single line third verse sounds deliberate, not incomplete. His key structural discipline is the rock solid tempo and groove pumped out with his foot: all the free energy roiling in this performance flows from that. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There is an understandable but hobbling tendency for reviewers to characterize Hooker's style as raw and primitive. Michael Gray provides a nuanced case for this characterization and its contrary, describing Hooker's performance  approach as a "shambling style that seemed as old as voodoo chants yet always managed to sound modern and knowing" (encyc page 328).
                          </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Connections to Dylan</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            One of Dylan's first big breaks was a billing as Hooker's opening act for two weeks in April 1961 at Gerde's Folk City, a mainstay of the Greenwich Village folk music scene . Dylan's friend Sybil Weinberger said that "Dylan loved Hooker and that whenever he was playng, Bob would there" (Gray, encyc 329). Hooker had this to say about Dylan in 1985:
                            "I met him when I was playing in the coffeehouses. He wasn't famous then but he came by to see me. We played some shows together and he'd come back to my place and we'd stay up all night playin' and drinkin' wine." (Gray, encyc 329) Though Dylan's version of "Highway 51" bears no obvious resemblance to Hooker's, the bluesman's elastic approach to form may have rubbed off on Dylan during those all-night jams.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There was a professional connection too: both Dylan and Hooker were managed by Albert Grossman, the shrewed, hard-nosed businessman credited with enabling Dylan's tremendous commercial success in the 1960's.
