          A term coined by author Greil Marcus to describe the relentlessly spooky American roots music on the legendary <a href='http://www.folkways.si.edu/explore_folkways/anthologyfolk.aspx' target='_blank'>Anthology of American Folk Music</a> compiled by hermetecist Harry Smith with the express intent of transmuting leaden 50's pop culture into gold. The recording was a key inspiration for the Greenwich Village folk revival and Dylan was no doubt influenced by it. Marcus originally used the term for an essay title in the booklet accompanying the '97 CD box set re-issue of the anthology. He later used it as the title for a <a href='http://blogcritics.org/book-review-the-old-weird-america/' target='_blank'>book</a> on the secret music made by Bob Dylan and the Band while in seclusion in Woodstock, New York, in 1967, some of which was later released as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basement_Tapes' target='_blank'>'The Basement Tapes'</a>.

                      Several blues recordings about Highway 51 had been released by the time Dylan covered this theme on his 1962 debut album "Bob Dylan". Blues resarcher Paul Oliver provides this:

                      On his "Highway 51",Dylan integrates blues and rockabilly influences and possibly contributes one original verse. My intuitions suspect a remote influence of Leadbelly's "Gallis Pole" but this is just a hunch. Like most of the "Bob Dylan" album -- largely a collection of rugged, idiosyncratic interpretations of traditional blues and American folk songs -- it is a likeable,if not fully-baked, harbinger of the

                          <h3>Overview</h3>
                          Though steeped in folk music from his late teens,Dylan never entirely lost interest in r&b and rock-n-roll. His debut record came out a few years after his scandalous Little Richard-inspired Hibbing High talent show gig in '56, perhaps the first rock performance where an instrument was destroyed on stage. As early Dylan champion Robert Shelton notes:
                        </p>
                        <div class="well">
                          <em>
                           "In his first year around the Village (i.e. Greenwich Village in Manhattan), Dylan insisted he was a country or rockabilly singer, or just a singer— but not a folk singer. “Highway 51” may be the first folk-rock recording, even without electric instruments or rhythm section...here are all the elements of folk-rock without electrification."
                          </em>
                        </div>
                        <h3>General Approach</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          Adapting one from the Elvis Presley playbook, Dylan takes a Mississippi delta blues tune and gives it a nervous rockabilly makeover. Presley's approach to <a href="spotify:track:5IM3mYyWYsKUSukMGYYq1U">Arthur Crudup's "That's Alright,Mama" </a>on his <a href="spotify:track:4O958xeV2blAhD95Qo24nc">legendary Sun Records debut session</a> is significantly different from Dylan's re-paving of Highway 51 here. Where Presley's interpretation simmers, Dylan's boils over. The guitar part sounds like a sped-up version of the opening guitar riff heard on the Everly Brothers '57 hit "Wake Up Little Susie" (and perhaps served as a groove template for the Dylan original "That's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding"). The liner notes to "Bob Dylan" confirm this:"A diesel-tempoed "Highway 51" is of a type sung by the Everly Brothers, partially rewritten by Dylan".
                        </div>
                         <h3>The voice</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          In an earnest,resourceful effort to come to terms with his varied influences, Dylan combines blues-inflected raspiness and an indeterminate hillbilly drawl and it works okay. I detect the influence of Dave Van Ronk here as well. Whether deliberate or happenstance, he's not so much imitiating his vocal precedents as shaping something original that suits both his idiosyncratic chops and emergent storytelling pyrotechnics.
                        </div>
                         <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>Dylan may have gotten verses 1 and 3 from Tommy McClennan's "New Highway 51" recorded in 1940 for the Bluebird Label, but these could also have been open source material circulating in the early 60's Greenwich Village folk scene. They're definitely not original. Verse 2,on the other hand,is either really obscure or a Dylan original that is idiomatic,deft and loosely autobiographical:
                          </p>
                          <p class="well">
                            <em>
                              Well, I know that highway like I know my hand<br/>
                              Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand<br/>
                              Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
                            </em>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Wisconsin borders Minnesota and is actually the northern terminus of Highway 51. Georgraphical inaccuracy is compensated for by the better phrasing provided by a three instead of a four syllable word.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          From a compositional standpoint, verse 2 nicely bridges verses 1 and 3. In verse 1, Dylan indicates he knows approximate whereabouts of his woman  but is skeptical he will find her. Verse 2 informs the listener that he is fully familiar with the road but its terminus in "No Man's Land" emphasizes his anxiety that the pursuit will end badly. Verse 3 has him considering premature death and burial on Highway 51. A grave site of indeterminate nearness to his unrequited love interest is likely as close as he'll get to her.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          It's an open question why Curtis Jones was given songwriting credits on Dylan's debut album: Jones's spectral,elegant "Highway 51 Blues" -- though addressing the same topics -- bears no direct resemblance to the Dylan version in either performance style or actual lyrics.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                         <h3>Musical Form and Performance Characteristics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                         
                         <p>
                          Dylan explicitly covers pursuit and death in his lyrics but doesn't mention means of travel. Instead, his relentlessly percussive guitar part effectively suggests the roar of a revving combustion engine sans muffler, becoming both proxy vehicle (a triumph spitfire perhaps) and background chorus. I hear the hypnotic ferocity of Leadbelly's guitar part on "Gallis Pole" as an inspriation for the part's mood and intensity if not its technical specifics, but that's admittedly a long-longshot.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                         Dylan evokes rural blues performance practice is in his approach to song structure:he ignores the conventional 12-bar, 4/4 blues form, opting for a fluid conversation between voice and guitar. His hurtling joyride  down Highway 51 does consistently follow the common AAB blues lyric form, end-rhymes and all. Dylan pares down the chord progression to I-IV-I-V-I in all verses. While sticking to the progression in every verse,chord changes happen at will, ignore all traffic lights and occassionally weave into the opposite lane.
                       </p>
                       NOTE:mention Leadbelly Gallis pole here and Van Ronk

                       <h3>Connection to Dylan's Version</h3>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Dylan could have taken verses 1 and 2 from this recording made by McLennan and an unknown upright bass player on May 10, 1940 in Chicago for the Bluebird label. It's possible that it was available on LP in '62  or Dylan could have heard it on a 78. Dylan got verses 1 and 3 of his version from somewhere.
                      </p>
                      <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                      <p class="txtFormat">

                        McClennan covers unrequited love in verse 1 and death/burial arrangments in verse 2 with the same lyrics heard in the Dylan version. Covering the travel motif in verse 3,McLennan's  "Greyhound Bus" reference is noteworthy for its artful synecdoche describing the iconic bus company logo -- a "tongue sticking on the side" -- that compactly symbolizes the singer's panting urgency to get to his woman. It's ambiguous who is singing the B line or to whom it is addressed:"If you buy your ticket/Swear 'fore God, that man'll let you ride". McClennan efficiently fuses two dialogs: one between singer and listener and another between ticket agent and would-be passenger. The verse also hints that the singer can't afford the fare -- a frequent complaint in blues lyrics. Given these very "Dylanesque" ingenuities, it's kind of surprising Bob didn't cop the verse for his version. Maybe he didn't hear this record after all.....

                      </p>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        Verse 4 talks about two means of travel and two girlfriends. It's a little complicated. His local woman has bought him a car that he then uses to get to the Greyhound bus that will take him to his absent, Highway 51 girlfriend. Verse 5 has McClennan actually living on Highway 51 and promising potential visitors ( preferably female one imagines) a good time. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        As is common in blues, McClennan uses collage rather than linear narrative to organize his impressions, quite possibly improvising on the spot. But -- thanks to McClennan's forcefully persuasive delivery --  the listener has no trouble accepting that Highway 51 is at once a road, a happy home, and a grave.
                      </p>
                       <h3>Musical Form and Performance Characteristics</h3>

                      <p class="txtFormat">
                        McLennan's robust gravelly voice is complemented by his percussive guitar style that alternates insistent, quarter-beat, strumming with razor-sharp single-note figures, suggesting the respective roles of pounding bass and chattering snare drums in a conventional trap set. He effortlessly maintains a sinuous, highly variable accompaniment that simulataneously challenges and complements his vocal phrasing -- a tour-de-force example of rhythmic indepdence between voice and fingers ( and foot for that matter). It grooves convincingly at a tempo considerably slower than Dylan's rockabilly joyride. McClennan uses the conventional 12-bar blues form as a reference point but isn't bound to it. The lively dialog between voice and guitar benefits greatly from this elastic approach to song form and the bass player manages to hang in.

                        <h3>Connection To Dylan's Version</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                        Dylan's version of "Highway 51 Blues" on his debut album was credited to bluesman Curtis Jones, who did record a song with this title in 1938 for the Vocalion label. The two versions -- though addressing the same topics -- are not otherwise remotely similar, so one can only speculate why Columbia thought it was obliged to list Jones as songwriter. 
                        </div>

                        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                          <div class="txtFormat">
                            <p>
                              Though Dylan may not have heard this song at the time he recorded "Highway 51",these lyrics possess qualities characteristic of Dylan's most accomplished work:
                              <ul>
                                <li>rhythmically complex phrasing</li>
                                <li>collage narrative that tells a story without linear sequencing</li>
                                <li>deft usage of consonance,assonance, and alliteration</li>
                                <li>highly original re-working of stock blues phrases and motifs</li>
                              </ul>
                              They are spooky, allusive, and inflected with sly humor throughout. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              While Dylan and McClennan open with hot pursuit of a love interest, Jones pleas in <strong>verse 1</strong> to an estranged lover for forgiveness -- perhaps to avoid retribution for bad behavior. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Verse 2</strong> deals with the premature death/burial site motif and indicates train tracks -- "the Frisco line" -- as a gravesite landmark. The juxtaposition of final resting place with elevated train tracks subtly alludes to the heaven-bound train of the saved so prevalent in gospel music of the period. 
                            </p>
                             <p>
                              In <strong>verse 3</strong>, Jones tries to freeload a bus ride. His request of the driver to ride "the blinds" smartly refashions a stock blues folkore motif where the impvoverished would-be passenger petitions a train engineer or conductor for a free ride in a covert, dangerous section of the train but is denied passage. Here Jones pre-empts the bus driver's anticipated response with the resolution to "swing right on behind" if he can't board. This is decades before skate boards or roller blades so it's hard to guess what form of travel he's talking about, but the phrase does effectively express his determination to ride the bus by whatever means neccessary, however dangerous. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Abruptly moving from desperation to largesse, <strong>verse 4</strong> finds Jones offering comfortable assylum to a woman fleeing her unhinged boyfriend in the singer's mansion on the highway. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Jones segues back to despair in <strong>verse 5</strong>. He wistfully recalls he and his woman walking together down Highway 51 in the A lines but then answers in the B line with future-tense speculation of their unreported death in a bad accident. The odd juxtaposition of past and future tenses intensifies the collage quality of these lyrics, offsetting warm reminisence with impending anonymous tragedy.
                            </p>
                           
                            <p>
                              Also notable is the skillful use of consonance, assonance, illiteration, internal rhyme, and judicious placement of some phrasing pyrotechnics. As an example of the latter, in the verse 1 B phrase we have:
                            </p>
                            <p class="well">
                              <em>
                                "I don't want nobody have to come a-here for me"
                              </em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              ...that's thirteen syllables evenly spaced and packed into two and a half quarter-note notes or 10 sixteenth notes-- a tricky 13:10 polyrhythm. This is a challenge to sing and hard to either improvise or compose. And he's accompanying himself with an independent ryhthm in his right hand and holding down the bass line in his left on the piano.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              The verse 4 A1 phrase delivers this ingenious Chinese box of phonics:
                            </p>

                            <p class="well">
                              <em>

                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Starting from the endpoints, there is an internal rhyme between "Baby" and "Buggy" as well as consonance. The endpoints wrap another consonance between "Good" and "Get", which is also echoed in the end-word "buggy". In addition to intricate sound design, "buggy" puns on yet another means of travel.

                          <p>
                            Jones performance is characteristic of urban blues with its disicplined adherence to the 4/4 12-bar blues form througout. But he brilliantly plays against this predictable regularity with wild polyrhythmic excursions in both piano and vocal phrasing. 
                            Suffice to say, Jones was a superb blues piano player and a master of rhythtmic independence. His high,spectral tenor voice and somewhat unusual choice of minor key  add immensely to the tune's sustained spooky mood. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           He also demonstrates accomplished song craft here.The lyrics are simultaneously earthy and other-wordly. This is a travel song that incants re-invented folklore to quietly transport the listener to some obscure, dark region of the astral plane.

                          Jazz Gillum's "Good Old 51 Highway" is a fine example of the 30's Chicago blues style known as "the Bluebird Beat". Named after Victor's susbidiary blues label,it combined elements of vaudeville-based "classic" and Mississippi Delta country blues. The style is conventionally understood as reflecting aspirations to urbanity inflected with sentimental nostalgia for rural origins by recent African-American transplants to Chicago from the Missisippi Delta -- a kind of sepia tin pan alley. This seems sociologically naive and the assumed dichotomy between the urbane and the rustic is unconvincing. The stylistic fusion is certainly there but is better understood as a dialog between two nuanced, developed musical genres and cultural milieus. The eduring appeal of artists like Gillum, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Washboard Sam, and  Big Maceo among several others was their ability to take advantage of musical urbanisms such as regular musical structures, and clever poular songwriting craft without diluting the expressive power,folkloric reservoir, or subtle rhythmic craft characteristic of their "downhome" delta sources.

                        <h3>Connection To Dylan's Version</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          There is no discernible direct connection to Dylan's version. It's another great example of how blues artists fashion personal statements from a reservoir of stock topics and associated sub-themes. Like much of Dylan's work, Gillum's tune qualifies as an original work while unabashedly drawing from a traditional open source repository.

                        <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            More than any other lyrics in this playlist, Gillum's display careful linear development while covering the common themes of estranged love, means of travel, destitution, and death in a highly original way. This story is the only one in the playlist to begin with the estranged lover talking. Bending convention, it is not Gillum that "woke up this morning" in verse 1, but his "baby". Another original twist is that she announces to him that she's the one hitting the road. Without identifying what caused the estrangement, verse 2 compounds the qualified suggestion of Gillum's bewilderment in verse 1 with the sting of public humiliation: she refuses to talk to him and asks her friends for directions to the highway. The means of travel for pursuit introduced in Verse 3 is an unenthusiastic fantasy about hitch-hiking, telegraphing that the singer is broke and going nowhere fast. Verse 4 expands on this feeling of frustrated indolence and charts its progression to violent yet impotent rage. The "machine" he doesn't have suggests a few things at once: a gun ( a machine gun perhaps), an automobile or maybe evan a steamroller, and a properly functioning penis. Regarding the premature death theme, Gillum's is the only one where the narrator survives; it's those who've crossed him who get "mowed down";

                        <h3>Performance Characteristics</h3>
                        <div class="txtFormat">
                          <p>
                            As the moniker "Jazz" would suggest, Gillum was influenced by current popular music. There are certainly precedents for his understated, slightly nasal vocal style in  earlier Mississippi delta blues. If he was also aspiring to a current jazz vocal style, it would be the honeyed nonchalant yawn of Jack Teagarden and not Armstrong's outgoing energetic grit.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Gillum's understated vocal delivery exhibits not urban coolness but smoldering,understated feelings of heartbreak,humilation and raw anger. His expert falsetto harmonica lines wistfully poise contemporary jazz trumpet and clarinet influences on a firm foundation of southern rural blues and string band harmonica conventions. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            "Good Old Highway 51" was recorded in June of 1938 with Big Bill Broonzy on guitar, Washboard Sam on washboard, and unknown standup bass. It is a smooth, jazzy, and  accomplished performance that understates without obscuring delta blues udercurrents. One hears a deliberate effort to conform to contemporary popular music conventions -- regulated song structure throughout, crisp unobtrusive accompaniment, and pre-meditated intros and outros. While this assimilation of popular songwriting conventions is often understood as reflecting a cultrual or commercial aspiration, it may be little more than an mass production efficiency tactic to assure delivery of a finished product in a predictable amount of time.
